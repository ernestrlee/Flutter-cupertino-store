# Cupertinostore

Cupertino Store is a Flutter UI exercise from a Google code lab.  This exercise demonstrates the
use of Cupertino widgets that are styled for iOS, such as a date picker and bottom tab bar.

The bottom tab bar switches between products, search, and shopping cart,  allowing the user to
browse or search through products and add items to the shopping cart where a total cost is
calculated.

Note: This is not a functional app.
